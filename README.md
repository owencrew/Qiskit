# Qiskit
Script which prints the current queue times and number of qbits of various IBM quantum computers available through cloud access. Runs quantum algorithms with Qiskit to generate superposition and entanglement of electrons using CNOT and Hadamard gates. Returns averages of expectation values over 500 executions, and includes visualisations on the Bloch sphere.
